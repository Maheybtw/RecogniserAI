### üß† Overview
**RecogniserAI** introduces adaptive feedback-driven learning control for neural networks.  
It dynamically tunes internal parameters such as learning rate and efficiency targets in real time, improving convergence stability and energy efficiency.


---

### üí° Use Cases

RecogniserAI is designed for developers, researchers, and students exploring adaptive optimisation and self-regulating AI systems.  
Its flexible architecture makes it easy to integrate into existing PyTorch workflows or serve as a foundation for experimentation.

**üî¨ Research and Academia**
- Study feedback-based control in deep learning
- Prototype self-tuning optimisation systems
- Reproduce and extend adaptive learning experiments

**‚öôÔ∏è Applied Machine Learning**
- Automatically tune learning rates and efficiency targets in real time  
- Improve model stability during training for difficult tasks (GANs, diffusion, RL)
- Monitor and optimise energy efficiency during large-scale training

**üå± Sustainable and Efficient AI**
- Track and reduce computational energy use  
- Develop ‚Äúgreen AI‚Äù solutions with adaptive energy balancing

**üß© Experimental Optimisation**
- Create models that *learn how to learn* through closed-loop adaptive control  
- Build new training paradigms based on dynamic feedback rather than static schedules

---

> RecogniserAI bridges control theory and deep learning ‚Äî bringing adaptive intelligence to the optimisation process itself.
